### Yosa Buson-- as ripped-off by Henry Kapteyn [KEEP THIS]
Here are three examples of haiku poems from Yosa Buson (1716-1784), a haiku master poet and painter:

A summer river being crossed
how pleasing
with sandals in my hands!

Light of the moon
Moves west, flowers' shadows
Creep eastward.

In the moonlight,
The color and scent of the wisteria
Seems far away.

Here are three examples of haiku from Kobayashi Issa (1763-1828), a renowned haiku poet:

O snail
Climb Mount Fuji,
But slowly, slowly!

Trusting the Buddha, good and bad,
I bid farewell
To the departing year.

Everything I touch
with tenderness, alas,
pricks like a bramble.

### Masaoka Shiki, as also quoted by Henry Kapteyn [KEEP THIS]
Here are seven examples of haiku poems from Masaoka Shiki (1867-1902), credited with reviving the haiku and developing its modern format:

I want to sleep
Swat the flies
Softly, please.

After killing
a spider, how lonely I feel
in the cold of night!

For love and for hate
I swat a fly and offer it
to an ant.

A mountain village
under the piled-up snow
the sound of water.

Night; and once again,
the while I wait for you, cold wind
turns into rain.

The summer river:
although there is a bridge, my horse
goes through the water.

A lightning flash:
between the forest trees
I have seen water.

Natsume Soseki (1867-1916) was a widely respected novelist who also had many fairy tales and haiku published. Here are three examples of his haikus:

The lamp once out
Cool stars enter
The window frame.

Plum flower temple:
Voices rise
From the foothills

The crow has flown away:
swaying in the evening sun,
a leafless tree.

Past the black winter trees,

a gentle wave
